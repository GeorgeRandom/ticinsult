 # HEY.

This is an attempt at a game of *tic-tac-toe*, with the Xs and Os replaced by customizable insults.
It is based on an assignment by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript), 
and now includes an "unbeatable" AI mode.

--- To improve:
- Strange behavior when player 1 wins (needs 1 more click to reset), probably due to a timer somewhere being too encapsulated.
- Code is super ugly.
- Needs way more flowers.
